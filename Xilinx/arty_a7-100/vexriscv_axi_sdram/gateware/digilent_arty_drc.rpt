2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IOBUFDS/IBUFDS (in IOBUFDS macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IOBUFDS_1/IBUFDS (in IOBUFDS_1 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg input VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#7 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/memory_to_writeBack_MUL_HH_reg input VexRiscv/memory_to_writeBack_MUL_HH_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#8 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/memory_to_writeBack_MUL_HH_reg input VexRiscv/memory_to_writeBack_MUL_HH_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg output VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_HL_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg output VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LH_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg output VexRiscv/execute_to_memory_MUL_LL_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net main_crg_clkin is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin i_0/O, cell i_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT i_0 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    FDCE_3 {FDCE}
    FDCE_1 {FDCE}
    FDCE_2 {FDCE}
    FDCE {FDCE}
    FDCE_4 {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
